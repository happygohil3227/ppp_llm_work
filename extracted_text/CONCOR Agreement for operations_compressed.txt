Time of two hours (entry to exit), the Concessionaire shall be liable to pay to Railway
Administration, Locomotive Detention Charges for every hour (or part thereof) for which the
locomotive is detained beyond the Free Waiting Time. Provided however, if a locomotive is
detained for a period of more than eight (8) hours at any Rail Terminal (either the Rail
Terminal of origin or of termination, as the case may be), then, without prejudice to the
Concessionaire's liability to pay to Railway Administration the Locomotive Detention
Charges, Railway Administration shall have the right, but not the obligation, to withdraw
and/remove the locomotive from such Rail Terminal, In case Railway Administration
withdraws and/or remove the locomotive from the Rail Terminal after detention of 8 hours,
the detention along with movement charges shall be levied without granting any free time.
In the event Railway Administration withdraws the locomotive in accordance with the
