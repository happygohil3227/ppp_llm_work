  "analysis": "Finding:\nDocument B allocates demand and traffic risk more explicitly to the Applicant, requiring them to maintain a minimum level of traffic and bear associated costs, while Document A is silent on explicit demand and traffic risk allocation.\n\nComparison Insight:\nDocument B provides a clearer allocation of demand and traffic risk, placing the responsibility on the Applicant to maintain traffic levels and bear costs, which introduces financial and operational risks. Document A's silence on these risks creates uncertainty for the Concessionaire, potentially affecting their ability to manage demand fluctuations and traffic changes.\n\nImpact on Cash Flows:\nIn Document B, the explicit allocation of demand and traffic risk to the Applicant could lead to more predictable cash flows if traffic levels are maintained, but also poses a downside risk if traffic falls below required levels, leading to additional costs or operational disruptions. Document A's lack of explicit risk allocation may result in unpredictable cash flows due to uncertainty in managing demand and traffic risks.\n\nClause Evidence:\n- Document A: The document does not contain specific clauses addressing demand and traffic risk allocation.\n- Document B: \n  - \"The Applicant shall pay freight and also all other charges (including siding, placement and withdrawal charges, where leviable) on traffic to and from the siding from the date of opening...\" (Clause 16(a))\n  - \"Siding, where the traffic is lower than these limits, should be closed if the owner does not undertake to electrify the siding at his cost.\" (Clause 1(c))\n  - \"To refuse supplies of wagons or other, rolling stock for the Applicant... in the event of non-payment by the Applicant...\" (Clause 19(d))\n\nEvidence Strength: STRONG"
