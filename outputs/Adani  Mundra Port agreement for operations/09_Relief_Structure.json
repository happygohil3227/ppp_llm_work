  "analysis": "SECTION: Relief Structure\n\nLEGAL POSITION:\n- The contract explicitly allows for relief in the event of a Force Majeure, which includes Non-Political Events, Indirect Political Events, and Political Events, as defined in Articles 15.2, 15.3, and 15.4. The relief is conditional upon the Affected Party notifying the other Party within 7 days of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event (Article 15.5).\n- The contract mandates that the Affected Party provide regular reports on the Force Majeure Event and its impact (Article 15.5).\n- The contract explicitly states that the Agreement Period shall be extended by the duration of the Force Majeure Event (Article 15.6).\n- The contract restricts any Party from claiming costs, losses, or damages from the other Party during the Force Majeure Event (Article 15.6).\n- The contract allows for termination if a Force Majeure Event persists for 180 days or more within a 365-day period, with a 15-day notice period for representation (Article 15.7).\n\nECONOMIC IMPLICATION:\n- The extension of the Agreement Period due to Force Majeure ensures that the Concessionaire is not economically disadvantaged by events beyond its control, preserving the economic balance of the contract.\n- The restriction on claiming costs, losses, or damages during a Force Majeure Event implies that both parties bear their own economic burdens during such events, potentially impacting cash flow and financial planning.\n\nBANKABILITY IMPACT:\n- From a lender and investor perspective, the clarity on Force Majeure relief and the extension of the Agreement Period enhance the contract's bankability by reducing uncertainty and protecting the Concessionaire's interests.\n- The ability to terminate the contract after a prolonged Force Majeure Event provides a clear exit strategy, which may be viewed favorably by lenders concerned about prolonged non-performance.\n\nCLAUSE EVIDENCE:\n- \"The Affected Party shall not be entitled to any relief for or in respect of a Force Majeure Event unless it shall have notified the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event not later than 7 (seven) days after the Affected Party knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of its occurrence...\" (Article 15.5)\n- \"If any Force Majeure Event occurs before the expiry of this Agreement, the Agreement Period and the dates set forth in the Agreement shall be extended by a period equal in length to the duration for which such Force Majeure Event subsists...\" (Article 15.6)\n- \"If a Force Majeure Event subsists for a period of 180 (one hundred and eighty) days or more within a continuous period of 365 (three hundred and sixty five) days, either Party may in its discretion terminate this Agreement by issuing a written termination notice...\" (Article 15.7)\n\nEVIDENCE_STRENGTH: STRONG",
