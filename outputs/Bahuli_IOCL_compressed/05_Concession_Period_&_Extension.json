There are no explicit clauses detailing the length of the concession or the conditions under which it may be extended.\n\nECONOMIC IMPLICATION:\n- The absence of explicit terms regarding the concession period and its extension creates uncertainty for both the concessionaire and the government. This could lead to potential disputes or renegotiations, affecting the stability and predictability of revenue streams and investment returns.\n\nBANKABILITY IMPACT:\n- From a lender and investor perspective, the lack of clarity on the concession period and extension terms poses a significant risk.
