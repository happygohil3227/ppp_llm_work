  "analysis": "SECTION: Change in Law & Policy Risk\n\nLEGAL POSITION:\n- The contract is silent on explicit provisions regarding \"Change in Law & Policy Risk.\" There are no clauses that directly address how changes in law or policy would affect the rights and obligations of the parties involved in the agreement. This indicates an absence of explicit risk allocation for changes in law or policy.\n\nECONOMIC IMPLICATION:\n- Due to the absence of explicit provisions on change in law or policy, the economic implications are uncertain. The lack of clarity could lead to potential disputes or renegotiations if a change in law or policy significantly impacts the cost or feasibility of the project. This uncertainty could affect the financial planning and risk assessment of the project.\n\nBANKABILITY IMPACT:\n- From a lender and investor perspective, the absence of explicit clauses addressing change in law and policy risk could be seen as a weakness in the contract. This lack of clarity and risk allocation may increase the perceived risk of the project, potentially affecting its attractiveness to investors and lenders. They may require additional assurances or risk mitigation measures to compensate for this gap.\n\nCLAUSE EVIDENCE:\n- The document does not contain any clauses that explicitly address change in law or policy risk.\n\nEVIDENCE_STRENGTH: NONE",
